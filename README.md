# my-terminal-setup
My setup for using Vim and terminal together. 

I mainly use Mac OS X for working on machine learning with python.
I use iterm2 as my terminal on mac.
For terminal I use zsh and setup Oh-MY-Zsh with powerline9.k theme.

For Vim I use 
Vundle for package management in vim.
Jedi-vim as python autocomplete.
YouCompleteMe as autocomplete for another language (They have build-in python autocomplete but I perfer jedi-vim)
auto-pair for auto close bucket (eg. (){}[])
NERDTree for file navigation on vim.
Vim-airlane for status bar.
